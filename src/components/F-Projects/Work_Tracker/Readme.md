# Work Tracker

## Brief description

This application is mainly created to track hours and to help calculate income\
earned at work where different rates apply depending on the day of the week and time of the day.\
It is also created to practice full stack development including frontend,\
user interface created in React, and backend build in Node.js.\
At the moment I’m not entirely sure which DB I will use for this project but\
probably it will be either Mongo DB or MySQL.

### FrontEnd 

#### ToDo

- [x] calendar tab
- [ ] calendar to specify days off
        This calendar needs to specify days off and then on save create year with earnings. It should\
        be saved in the list of rotas. It should be saved in Redux and sent to back end where saved in DB.
- [ ] component with saved rotas
        This component needs to have lis:
            - Year rota.
            - Annual earnings.
            - Edit button.
- [ ] component to select same repeated days in the week
- [ ] timeline tab
- [ ] timeline with division for hours
- [ ] colored progress bar on the top of the time line. I should indicate basic H and overtime H
- [ ] sumary of the worked hours, located above the time line with colored squares accordingly to basic H or overtime H
- [ ] progres circle to visually show profit for a day
- [x] menu
