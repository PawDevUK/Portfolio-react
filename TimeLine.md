Focused on component modernization and UI improvements. Converted Footer from class-based to functional component using React hooks (useState) for state management. Replaced custom Burger component with Material-UI IconButton, implementing MenuIcon and CloseIcon with disabled ripple effect and transparent hover background for cleaner appearance. Added Ubuntu font family (Light and Medium weights) to the project with proper @font-face declarations in index.css, applying them to Footer Nick and Mobile Menu LogoHeader. Removed particles.js from Footer for better performance and simpler design. Updated README documentation by converting TODO lists to GitHub checkbox format (- [ ] for incomplete, - [x] for completed). Fixed multiple build configuration issues in jsconfig.json by keeping baseUrl: "src" with ignoreDeprecations: "6.0" to silence TypeScript warnings. Corrected import paths in app.jsx and configureStore.js. Fixed CSS comment syntax issues in styled-components (changed // to /**/). Improved project card layouts by reducing header size, enlarging card width, and adjusting spacing. Updated Polish translations in reactComponent.config.js to match English content. Made 35 commits total, modified 15 files with 451 insertions and 481 deletions (net -30 lines). Successfully migrated from custom components to Material-UI for better accessibility and maintainability while maintaining the application's design language.
