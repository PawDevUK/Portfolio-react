#### Technical Decisions

1. **Styled-Components over Tailwind CSS:**
   - Initially experimented with Tailwind CSS for modern utility-first approach
   - Decided to revert to styled-components for:
     - Consistency with existing component architecture
     - Better integration with Material-UI components
     - More maintainable component-scoped styling
     - Existing team familiarity

2. **Component Architecture:**
   - Maintained React class components for Work_Tracker
   - Used functional components with hooks for Presentation
   - Leveraged Redux for state management (WT_Route)

3. **Data Visualization:**
   - Implemented responsive grid layouts
   - Added interactive elements (hover effects, click handlers)
   - Color-coded visual indicators for work status
   - Gradient backgrounds for visual appeal

#### Next Steps / TODO

- [ ] Consider adding export functionality for work data (PDF/Excel)
- [ ] Implement data filtering and search capabilities
- [ ] Add charts/graphs for earnings trends
- [ ] Create mobile-responsive optimizations
- [ ] Add unit tests for Presentation component
- [ ] Consider API integration for real-time data updates
