# Time Line

## 06/11/25

**Evening (21:39):** Enhanced stack icons and adjusted particle effects. Added AI development tools to stack.config.js: ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Vercel logos with corresponding PNG images. Reduced particles repulse distance from 200 to 100 pixels to create smaller hover interaction circle. Updated README.md todo list. Restructured timeline to separate same-day work by time (Morning/Afternoon/Evening) instead of creating duplicate date entries. Split 06/11/25 articles.js entry into two separate timeline items with time-specific dates for better visual separation in timeline display. Made 3 commits, modified 9 files with 37 insertions and 14 deletions (net +23 lines plus 3 binary image files).

**Afternoon (12:50):** Optimized PDF download file size and quality, fixed deployment issues. Investigated excessive 25MB PDF file size caused by PNG format with scale: 2. Converted image format from PNG to JPEG with 0.95 quality compression, reducing file size from 25MB to 1.1MB. Increased scale parameter from 2 to 2.5 to improve visual quality while maintaining optimal file size around 2-3MB for better text sharpness and clarity. Removed useCORS: true configuration after determining it was unnecessary for same-domain images (default is false). Fixed Vercel deployment npm dependency conflict by creating .npmrc file with legacy-peer-deps=true flag to handle peer dependency resolution issues, and removed strict npm version requirement from package.json engines field (changed from npm: "8.5.0" to only requiring node >= 20). Made 6 commits, modified 4 files. Successfully balanced PDF quality with file size and resolved production deployment configuration.

**Morning (11:28):** Implemented PDF download functionality for CV page and resolved page break issues. Installed jspdf (v3.0.3) and html2canvas (v1.4.1) dependencies. Created DownloadCV component with async/await and multi-page support. Configured html2canvas with scale: 2, useCORS: true, ignoreElements for .no-pdf class, and onclone callback for dynamic CSS injection. Fixed page break issue where sections were cut in half by creating cv-h5-for-Donload class with margin-top: 120px. Enhanced cv.css with comma selector for property inheritance across cv-h5 variants. Restructured CV header with CSS Grid and flexbox for right-aligned download button. Made 8 commits, modified 4 files (78 insertions, 50 deletions).

Added fullYear24_25.json data file (9,415 lines) containing complete work calendar data for financial year 2024-25 and integrated it into Work_Tracker.jsx component with route handling for Presentation view. Updated Menu.jsx component (304 line changes) improving navigation between ClockInOut, Calendar, and Presentation views with enhanced Material-UI drawer implementation. Experimented with Tailwind CSS but reverted back to styled-components for consistency with existing codebase architecture and better integration with Material-UI components.

Replaced custom Burger component with Material-UI IconButton, implementing MenuIcon and CloseIcon with disabled ripple effect and transparent hover background. Added Ubuntu font family (Light and Medium weights) with proper @font-face declarations in index.css, applying them to Footer Nick and Mobile Menu LogoHeader.
